## Used Technology
* I decided to use Java because I know por this application i can use the JADE platform which will be great for the development of a multiagent system.
* Also, I used Eclipse because I have had some experience with it, and I know it can solve all the technical requeriments I have to  complete.
* It was necesary the use of external libs as also external software. It it necessary to use jade.jar which is the lib that give the support for the agents we will use. Also commons-codec.jar is important because it allow us to encode the information we take from the photos in a format it can be used by the external API.
* We will use the swing software windows builder, which allow us to create a graphic interface to facilitate the user the use of the application.
