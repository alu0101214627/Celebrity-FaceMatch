## Used Technology
* I decided to use Java because I know por this application i can use the JADE platform which will be great for the development of a multiagent system.
* Also, I used Eclipse because I have had some experience with it, and I know it can solve all the technical requeriments I have to  complete.
* It was necesary the use of external libs as also external software. It it necessary to use jade.jar which is the lib that give the support for the agents we will use. Also commons-codec.jar is important because it allow us to encode the information we take from the photos in a format it can be used by the external API.
* We will use the swing software windows builder, which allow us to create a graphic interface to facilitate the user the use of the application.

## Facial Recognition
* To develop the facial recognition part, I have used the external API [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com) where I had to create an application and connect it with the developed code with and APP Key, but also use a model which have been trained in the recognition of famous people, and it has also been connected by the model Key in the developed code.

## Comunication
* This multiagent system requires a communication between agents, whoch offers their services and also ask for them. To do this I have used the Directory Facilitator structure of JADE, but also the ACL messages so the agents can have a quite good comunication between them.
